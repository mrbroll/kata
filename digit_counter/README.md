This another personal kata.

###Problem###

Given an integer N, find the number of occurrences of the digit k:[0, 9] in the continuous sequence of numbers [0, N].
This should work for both positive and negative integers.

I have written 2 solutions for this problem: 1 brute-force, iterative approach, and a slightly more elegant, recursive approach.

The Iterative approach will take O(NLog10N) time, while the recursive approach only takes O(Log10N) time.
