This repo is for my code kata. These kata are not created by me, but taken from various sources:

+ [codekata.com](http://codekata.com/)
+ [Programming Pearls 2nd ed.](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Edition-Bentley/dp/0201657880/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1407465587&sr=8-1&keywords=programming+pearls)

I will primarily be doing these in c/c++, but might expand to other languages as I see fit.
